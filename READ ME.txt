-- Following are some guidelines you have to follow to Run the Website on your system

1) Put the "webproject" directory in the "www" directory of WAMP. Make sure to name it "webproject" else the routing won't work, as the home route is set to "/webproject."
2) Make sure the "webproject" directory contains 4 directories i.e "assets", "Controllers", "Models" and "Views", and three files i.e "index.php", "initSQL_new.sql" and "READ ME.txt".
3) Open your phpMyAdmin and run the "initSQL_new.sql" file to make the Database for the website.
4) Open the "webproject/Models/DBconfig.php" file and set the user and password of your phpMyAdmin user on line 15 and 16, respectively. 
5) Set the "post_max_size" and "upload_max_filesize" to "256M" in your WAMP -> PHP settings, else you will not be able to upload videos in the website.
6) Go to "localhost/webproject" to launch the website.
